# Reporting Bugs
This guides you through submitting a bug report for Mojaloop. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

## Before Submitting a Bug Report
Search the existing bugs list here: https://github.com/mojaloop/project/labels/bug

Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one

Note: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

Check the [FAQ](https://github.com/Mojaloop/mojaloop/blob/master/FAQ.md) in the Wiki for a list of common questions and problems.

Join the Mojaloop Slack #General Channel to connect with other developers or reach out to active community members.

## How Do I Submit a (Good) Bug Report?
Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. 

Please capture all the available information following the bug report template here: https://github.com/mojaloop/project/issues/new?template=bug_report.md . Providing more details help with reproducing, validating the bug report and subsequently fixing it. For example, If the problem is related to performance or memory, include a CPU profile capture with your report. Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens. Include details about your configuration and environment: Are you running locally or in AWS? What environment and version are you using?
